# Sequential implementation worklist

Implementation and Stage 06 production readiness are complete; no S1 scientific campaign has run. Read AGENTS.md first. Work in order from the first incomplete task. A checkbox becomes checked ONLY when its implementation AND required tests actually pass with report/journal evidence. Missing hardware/network/approval is BLOCKED,not passed. Stage capability,validation and scientific coverage are separate. Optional studies remain disabled until approval.

- [x] Stage06 required evidence reviewed and milestone committed; no scientific S1 training launched.

Stage06 status: **production_ready**, with scientific coverage **none**. Researcher choices D01-D18 and the corrected amendment remain sealed; on 2026-09-28 the researcher additionally approved `fingerprint_denominator_floor=1e-8` before training. This is solely a numerical guard for reported S_I/S, not an effect-size threshold: if `abs(baseline_sink)<1e-8`, the ratio is unavailable while baseline/probed sinks and their absolute difference are retained. `configs/production/s1_jobs_seed0.json` fixes nine physical seed-0 jobs for seven unique C0-C6 condition/seed pairs: RTX4080 SUPER C0/C1/C2/C5/C6 and RTX3090 C1/C2/C3/C4. C1/C2 are same-seed hardware bridges. The measured common microbatch is 4 × accumulation16 (64 sequences, 8,192 inputs and 8,128 shifted targets per update). RTX3090 C0/C5/C6 and RTX4080 C3 remain unmeasured/unused; C4/REL is3090-only. The verified external artifact tree, exact two-role environment, seed1729 16-batch calibration (`s_MSE=68.00580071126464`, `s_REL=0.120179255876581`), unchanged four component locks and nine root-bound configs all pass transitive validation. The production root is `2a11da9bb71957a4d6b3a2f93a34bd67491dd9d21d70577a7a10858930a8943e`. No 10k production run or Stage09 work has started. See `reports/stage06.json`.

## Stage07 - S2
Work order: [07_S2_PRETRAINING](design/e6a_v2/stages/07_S2_PRETRAINING.md).
- [x]07.1 Immutable public checkpoint/seed inventory capability; one public step0 entry is now resolved and verified.
- [x]07.2 Single Pythia-checkpoint evaluator/manifests on local CPU fixtures.
- [x]07.3 Opt-in trajectories,bounded cache/download,resume on local CPU fixtures.
- [x]07.4 Local tests and approved real network/GPU evidence.
- [x] Stage07 capability evidence reviewed and milestone committed; S2 scientific coverage remains absent.

Stage07 status: external capability acceptance COMPLETE using one immutable public Pythia-160m step0 checkpoint on the RTX 4080 SUPER. Its hashes, tokenizer, native rotary/masks, evaluator, restoration, resume and storage were measured. Full checkpoint coverage and the full-trajectory storage/download budget still require approval and measurement; no S2 scientific trajectory or coverage exists. See `reports/stage07.json`. Stage06 is now production-ready, without scientific coverage.

## Stage08 - S4/S5/S6
Work order: [08_S4_S5_S6](design/e6a_v2/stages/08_S4_S5_S6.md).
- [x]08.1 Anchor/route battery and model-local coordinate controls (CPU capability; real teacher calibration pending).
- [x]08.2 S5 reanalysis-only joins and contrasts (CPU capability; no production S1 records yet).
- [x]08.3 Domain/length panels and optional long contexts (CPU capability; optional long contexts disabled without approval/memory validation).
- [x]08.4 Study tests,new-teacher checks and approvedGPU smoke (RTX 4080 SUPER engineering qualification; S5 analysis has no GPU kernel).
- [x] Stage08 capability evidence reviewed and milestone committed; scientific coverage remains absent.

Stage08 status: capability and external qualification COMPLETE on the RTX 4080 SUPER using a pinned GPT-2-large teacher and a frozen engineering calibration panel. All ten fixed S4 probes responded at the predeclared numerical reporting floor; that observation is not a scientific transfer claim. Paired 40/128-token S6 GPU smoke passed on agent-authored engineering inputs. S5 remains read-only with no production C1/C2/C5/C6 records; none were fabricated. Optional 512/1024 contexts remain disabled. No S4/S5/S6 scientific coverage exists. See `reports/stage08.json`. Stage06 is now production-ready; Stage07 external capability acceptance is complete without scientific coverage. Stage09 has not started.

- [ ]09.1 Prespecified paired analyses and completeness checks.
- [ ]09.2 Traceable figure/table generation with raw seeds.
- [ ]09.3 Complete tests and offline clean-wheel/no-Upstream gate.
- [ ]09.4 Reports,manifests,remaining decisions,production commands.

- [ ] Stage09 evidence reviewed and milestone committed.

## Separate research execution opt-in
- [ ] Researcher approves/amends D01-D18 and relevant M01-M05.
- [x] Protocol/environment/artifact/hardware/calibration locks frozen for S1 seed0 production readiness.
- [ ] Operator explicitly launches each approved study/condition/seed.
- [ ] Actual completed coverage audited before paper claims.
- [ ] Separate authorization obtained before eventual Upstream deletion.


## Planned S5 utility extension (design only)

The [Sink-Aware Distillation Utility implementation plan](design/e6a_v2/studies/S5_SINK_AWARE_DISTILLATION_UTILITY_PLAN.md) is the design handoff for reusing S1 C1/C2/C5/C6. It specifies existing-record analysis and explicitly scoped retained-checkpoint supplements. Its SU0-SU8 implementation tasks are pending; Stage06 readiness remains blocked and no scientific coverage or Stage09 completion is implied.
