# Sequential implementation worklist

DESIGN ONLY: no experiment code,CPU/GPU acceptance or scientific campaign is marked complete. Read AGENTS.md first. Work in order from the first incomplete task. A checkbox becomes checked ONLY when its implementation AND required tests actually pass with report/journal evidence. Missing hardware/network/approval is BLOCKED,not passed. Stage capability,validation and scientific coverage are separate. Optional studies remain disabled until approval.

## Stage06 - S1/S3 and hardware
Work order: [06_S1_S3_INTEGRATION](design/e6a_v2/stages/06_S1_S3_INTEGRATION.md).
- [x]06.1 Independent S1/S3 configs and variant checks.
- [ ]06.2 Explicit approved job plans; no default sweeps.
- [x]06.3 Actual3090/4080 model/teacher/intervention/objective smoke.
- [ ]06.4 Measured profiles,common microbatch,calibration/resources.
- [ ]06.5 ActualGPU resume/precision tests and readiness locks.
- [ ] Stage06 required evidence reviewed and milestone committed; unavailableGPU marked BLOCKED.

Stage06 status: BLOCKED. Assigned-condition full-size smoke, causal evaluation, numerical diagnostics and checkpoint replay pass on both recorded devices. The RTX 3090 safe maxima are C1=16 and C2/C3/C4=8. The RTX 4080 SUPER sequence-128 full-cycle search, capped at the 3090 REL bound of 8, gives C0=8 and C1/C2/C5/C6=4. The measured two-device engineering candidate is **microbatch 4 × accumulation 16 = effective batch 64**; C5's repeated pass has a narrow free-VRAM margin. This is not an approved hardware lock: complete seven-divisor matrices, researcher approvals, production corpus/panels, C3/C4 calibration factors and readiness locks remain absent. See `reports/stage06.json`. No Stage07 work or production training started.

## Stage07 - S2
Work order: [07_S2_PRETRAINING](design/e6a_v2/stages/07_S2_PRETRAINING.md).
- [x]07.1 Immutable public checkpoint/seed inventory capability; actual public entries remain unresolved.
- [x]07.2 Single Pythia-checkpoint evaluator/manifests on local CPU fixtures.
- [x]07.3 Opt-in trajectories,bounded cache/download,resume on local CPU fixtures.
- [ ]07.4 Local tests and approved real network/GPU evidence.
- [ ] Stage07 evidence reviewed and milestone committed.

Stage07 status: CPU capability implemented and tested. Actual public checkpoint availability, measured download/storage budget and real network/GPU smoke are blocked pending explicit operator scope; no full S2 trajectory or scientific coverage exists. See `reports/stage07.json`. Stage06 production-readiness status remains BLOCKED.

## Stage08 - S4/S5/S6
Work order: [08_S4_S5_S6](design/e6a_v2/stages/08_S4_S5_S6.md).
- [x]08.1 Anchor/route battery and model-local coordinate controls (CPU capability; real teacher calibration pending).
- [x]08.2 S5 reanalysis-only joins and contrasts (CPU capability; no production S1 records yet).
- [x]08.3 Domain/length panels and optional long contexts (CPU capability; optional long contexts disabled without approval/memory validation).
- [ ]08.4 Study tests,new-teacher checks and approvedGPU smoke.
- [ ] Stage08 evidence reviewed and milestone committed.

Stage08 status: S4/S5/S6 CPU capability is implemented and the earlier CPU regression passes. Real GPT-2-large responsiveness qualification and authorized GPU/context smoke have not run, so 08.4 and the Stage08 exit gate remain open. No S4/S5/S6 scientific coverage exists. See `reports/stage08.json`. Stage06 and Stage07 blocks remain unchanged.

## Stage09 - Analysis and release
Work order: [09_ANALYSIS_RELEASE](design/e6a_v2/stages/09_ANALYSIS_RELEASE.md).
- [ ]09.1 Prespecified paired analyses and completeness checks.
- [ ]09.2 Traceable figure/table generation with raw seeds.
- [ ]09.3 Complete tests and offline clean-wheel/no-Upstream gate.
- [ ]09.4 Reports,manifests,remaining decisions,production commands.
- [ ]09.5 Release milestone and truthful handoff; no upstream deletion.

- [ ] Protocol/environment/artifact/hardware/calibration locks frozen.
- [ ] Operator explicitly launches each approved study/condition/seed.
