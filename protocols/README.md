# Approval lock boundary

The checked `design/e6a_v2/templates/` files are drafts. No production lock is
provided here, and `sinklab validate --production` requires one explicit
approved `protocol.lock.json` plus an exact digest in its run config.

An approved lock has `schema_version`, `payload`, and `sha256`. The digest is
SHA-256 of the UTF-8 JSON payload with sorted keys, compact separators, and
non-ASCII characters preserved. It excludes the enclosing digest field.
`payload` requires status `approved`, `production_ready: true`, a full source
commit, study, exact condition variants and device roles, the approved protocol body, named
approval evidence, and SHA-256 digests of artifact, environment, hardware,
and calibration locks. Stage 00 validates this boundary; later stages must
validate the detailed scientific contracts and measured lock contents.
The approval record must explicitly cover D01 through D18. The checked
`approval_draft.json` cannot serve as approval. `reuse_ledger.json` starts
empty because Stage 00 borrows no source code.

`sinklab validate --config configs/s1_c2_draft.json --seed 0` checks the
draft selection only. Validation never starts training or data preparation.
